You can mark when you start and finish each book, rate books you’ve read, and securely store your data using iCloud.

- Record start and finish dates for each book  
- Rate books you’ve completed  
- Sync and store data securely using iCloud  
- Clean and simple user interface built with SwiftUI  

## Technologies Used
- Swift — Core programming language  
- SwiftUI — For building the user interface  
- SwiftData — For local data persistence  
- MVC Architecture — For organizing the code structure  
- iCloud — For cloud-based data storage and synchronization 

 ## What’s New for Me in This App

1. Using **String Catalog** to localize the app into Arabic.  
   This was an amazing experience because it opened my eyes to how easily an app can be translated into my native language using String Catalog.

2. Using **SwiftData** to persist app data.  
   SwiftData surprised me with how simple and clean data persistence is compared to Core Data, especially in the way it manages relationships between models.

3. Syncing data using **iCloud**.  
   This was handled automatically by SwiftData without requiring manual implementation,only adding  ICloud capabilities  in my project
